  <h3>What I like</h3>
  <p>A horror movie is a movie that seeks to elicit a physiological reaction, such as an elevated heartbeat, using fear and shocking one’s audiences. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres. The first horror movie ever made was Le Manoir du Diable or "The Haunted Castle" in 1890 by Georges Méliès, after that movie others were made through the years, improving effects and histories, horror movies are really popular and there are some that are really popular and almost everybody knows like The shining, Psycho or the most popular horror movie ever made The exorcist.</p>

<p>Horror films develped out of a number of sources: folktales with devil characters, witchcraft, fables, myths, ghost stories, Grand Guignol melodramas, and Gothic or Victorian novels from Europe by way of Mary Shelley, Victor Hugo or Irish writer Bram Stoker, and American writers Robert Louis Stevenson and Edgar Allan Poe. Oscar Wilde's 1890 Faustian tale The Picture of Dorian Gray and H.G. Wells' 1896 story of The Island of Dr. Moreau were adapted into early film versions. In many ways, the expressionistic German silent cinema led the world in films of horror and the supernatural, and established its cinematic vocabulary and style. Many of the early silent classics would be remade during the talkies era.</p>

	<h3>History</h3>
	<p> In the beginning of horror movies, they were starred by monsters like Frankenstein or Dracula, then movies like Psycho or The birds introduced the natural horror, after that the zombies showed up for the first time on the big screen with the film White Zombie by Victor and Edward Halperin, then the serial supernatural killers appeared with movies like Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Actually, thanks to the advances of technologies horror movies have achieved a new level in special effects, unfortunately a lot of horror movies only care about making look scary to its villain and not about the story.</p>

  <h3>Why I Like</h3>
	<p>I chose this topic because I think that horror movies are interesting because they bring a whole new world of monsters and demons, which I think is pretty awesome because all of this comes from the imagination, better said, of the fears of a single person who Is able to transmit his fear to the people who watch his movie, is almost like magic, a terrifing one but still is magic
  </p>

	<p>My favorite horror movies are the Insidious Saga which is formed by 3 chapters (the fourth chapter will be released this year), I like them because the saga tries to take back the psicological horror of the 90´s and it doesn't abuse of jump scares like other actual films, this doesn't means that the movies don't use technologie to improve their special effects. The story of the film is also good, in the film is explained that there are people that can travel while they are sleeping (astral travel), but the problem is that if they travel to far they can get lost and their body can be possessed by demons</p>
